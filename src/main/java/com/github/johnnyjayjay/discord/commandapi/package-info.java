 * This is the main package for the CommandAPI.<br>
 * This framework is built around the interface {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.ICommand ICommand}.
 * It is the base interface for the user to create own commands. An alternative implementation is {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.AbstractCommand AbstractCommand}.<br>
 * {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.CommandSettings CommandSettings} is also one of the most important classes. It is used to control the commands and their execution as well as some other features.<br>
 * {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.AbstractHelpCommand AbstractHelpCommand} and {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.DefaultHelpCommand DefaultHelpCommand} belong to
 * the help command feature of this framework. AbstractHelpCommand provides a template for own implementations, whereas DefaultHelpCommand is the default implementation of this abstract class.<br>
 * {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.CommandEvent CommandEvent} is a sub class of {@code GuildMessageReceivedEvent} from JDA. It is used as a parameter type in {@code onCommand} from
 * {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.ICommand ICommand}.<br>
 * {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.SubCommand SubCommand} is an annotation that is used in {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.AbstractCommand AbstractCommand} to declare methods as sub command
 * methods. To see how this works, please refer to the examples or the readme file on github.<br>
 * {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.CommandSetException CommandSetException} is a {@code RuntimeException} that is thrown in case of any problems with {@link com.github.johnnyjayjay.discord.commandapi.CommandSettings CommandSettings}.
 * <p>
 * Please read the readme on github and take a look at the examples to see how it works.<br>I will give this documentation a revision in the future to provide more examples and helpful code.
